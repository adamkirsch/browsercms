Current Task:

## Big Tasks

* Do UX for the content library, admin and sitemap
* Implement implied features (Search/Notifications)


* Add BrowserCMS to the list of projects using Mercury

### UX Considerations

1. How should new content blocks be added to a page? Right now, the + button uses the old world flow.

### Notes

* Multiple versions of jquery being loaded breaks things.

## Admin Menu
* Reduce the different admin layouts (why are there so many?)
* Need to highlight active tab
* Need to highlight the active menu item
* Enforce link security for menus
* iframe means drop downs don't appear under page rather than over when editing a page.

## New Features to implement

* Implement search
* Implement notifications

## Developer Tasks

Style the following elements

* Edit Properties popover (currently centered and too small text)

# Points of Design Discussion

* What information should be visible on toolbar, what should be hidden?
* Should we turn the entire toolbar red for draft pages?

### Known Issues

1. When a user selects the page title, the block editing controls are enabled, though they do nothing. (Minor)

## 4.0 Release Testing

* Verify caching works (was refactored)
* Page editing - iframe is too long (1600px) but using 100% height is too short.
